Currently the version 1 of the hardware is functional tested with RPi CM4 and SOQuartz (external eMMC with manual patching). Plan is to deliver the functional software based on custom embedded Linux based on Buildroot/Yocto. Note: Project will be open sourced with documentation after test completion for Version 2. |
| MSLA resin printers | RM116-D4E32W  | Currently the RPi CM4 + LCD                                  | Raspbian/Linux                                          | The project is currently in experimental state, I am working on Linux driver for current state-of-the-art LCDs featured on resin printers. However, these LCDs use 2x 4-lane MIPI interface, thus I am experimenting with multiplexing MIPI on Rpi CM4 (which sucks). This is why I am reaching out to you - as ROCK3 features 2x 4-lane MIPI! This is a killer feature for such a project. Just to give you context; the resin 3D printing is extremely limited a dominated by Chitusystems. They have terrible closed ecosystem, unlike the open ecosystem available for FDM printers. It is really hard for open project to start, as there is a big obstacle in driving high-resolution LCDs required for these printers. |

Since it is inside a pc, the power will be delivered trough standard conectors in pcs like molex or sata power. Project will be fully opensource, and maybe there will be a kickstarter campaign for it. |
