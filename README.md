| MSLA resin printers | RM116-D4E32W  | Currently the RPi CM4 + LCD                                  | Raspbian/Linux                                          | The project is currently in experimental state, I am working on Linux driver for current state-of-the-art LCDs featured on resin printers. However, these LCDs use 2x 4-lane MIPI interface, thus I am experimenting with multiplexing MIPI on Rpi CM4 (which sucks). This is why I am reaching out to you - as ROCK3 features 2x 4-lane MIPI! This is a killer feature for such a project. Just to give you context; the resin 3D printing is extremely limited a dominated by Chitusystems. They have terrible closed ecosystem, unlike the open ecosystem available for FDM printers. It is really hard for open project to start, as there is a big obstacle in driving high-resolution LCDs required for these printers. |

Community will be encouraged to submit their PCB designs fitting aftermarket computers. A reference design for em350 will be provided, however a board for vastly popular eeePC would probably gain a lot of attention. Currently only Radxa CM3 is suitable, due to its unique LVDS output feature.

It would be nice for customers to have more options for CPU.  Integration/Development could be done with Radxa CM3 or Radxa CM3 SODIMM, but we prefer the SODIMM form factor in the final product.  We can also use eMMC modules in our carrier, but our customers prefer to use SD cards for their OS.
| OpenHD            | eMMC, prefer 2GB RAM, WiFi            | Raspi CM4 Compute Stick | Raspbian, Ubuntu | I'm one of the Core-Devs from the OpenHD Project, I would like to explore the possibilities to port and run OpenHD on RADXA Hardware. The main goal is to achieve better decoding and display latency with RADXA compared to Raspberry Pi 4/CM4. I hope that it'll be a good replacement for CM4 because it could be a drop-in replacement which will most likely reduce video latency. OpenHD is a Project, some even call it "suite", to enable digital video transmission via simple Wi-Fi-Adapters which minimal latency and high range/reliability.
