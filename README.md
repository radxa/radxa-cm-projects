| Other Notes:      | sataPi is a project that aims to fill the empty sata bay slots from a pc case with computing power. Since it is inside a pc, the power will be delivered trough standard conectors in pcs like molex or sata power. Project will be fully opensource, and maybe there will be a kickstarter campaign for it. |
